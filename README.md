# On-the-Map
A Udacity account is needed to log in to this app. 
The app allows users to view others' locations and shared hyperlinks. The user can post their own location and link,
as well as update after posting.
Data is retrieved using the Udacity and Parse APIs, and is visible in map and table views.

Note: this app no longer has full functionality due to the shut down of the Parse service.
